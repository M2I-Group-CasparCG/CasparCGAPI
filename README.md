# CasparCGAPI

When testing, our CasparCG server must have at list 3 channels declared in the casparcg.config file.
You can find a sample caspar.config in ./utilities/API/

You can use the ./utilities/API/CasparCG api.postman_collection.json JSON file to import API tests commands into Postman.
You can use Postman runner and run the "ini" bin to initialize CasparCG with the default media available on the server. 

The api documentation is available at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3948879/RVnZgd9U
