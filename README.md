# CasparCGAPI

You can use the ./utilities/API/CasparCG api.postman_collection.json JSON file to import API tests commands into Postman
The api documentation is available at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3948879/RVnZgd9U

When testing, our CasparCG server must have at list 3 channels declared in the casparcg.config file.
You can find a sample caspar.config in ./utilities/API/
